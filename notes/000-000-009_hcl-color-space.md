# 000-000-009: HCL Color Space

This space represents the visible colors on the base of:
- **Hue**: the colorwheel of the rainbow from red to violet
- **Chroma**: is the color intensity from gray to a chosen color
- **Luminance**: is the brightness of the color from black to white

Tips:
- To choose a palette, fix CL and toy with intervals on the H scale. 
  This can help distinguish unordered categories, too. 
- To relate ordered categories, change linearly in the CL plane.
- To communicate diverging opposite pick 2 hues and lerp between them and a bright common neutral point in the Luminance scale
